// draftApproved gates whether the rendered preamble shows the
// `[DRAFT 2026-05-19 — copy pending Karthi review]` footer. Default
// false; flip to true ONLY after Karthi reviews preambleBody and
// explicitly approves the copy.
//
// When you flip this to true, do the following in the SAME commit:
//   1. Read through preambleBody below and confirm it reflects the
//      approved copy (Karthi often tightens lines during review).
//   2. Verify TestRenderPreamble_ApprovedMode_OmitsMarker passes —
//      i.e. no stray "DRAFT" or "pending Karthi review" string
//      survives in preambleBody.
//   3. Update RESUME.md / TODO.md if either references the DRAFT
//      state.
//
// Why this is a const rather than a CI grep: c3 is a maintainer-led
// project, not a multi-contributor codebase. The forcing function is
// the human reading this comment when they make the change, plus the
// paired DraftMode/ApprovedMode tests that pin the rendered output to
// the const's value. No "you can't change this constant" test — that
// pattern is hostile when the maintainer is the one approving.
const draftApproved = true // Karthi approved 2026-05-19

// preambleBody is the educational text shown at the very top of
// `c3-broker setup` before any prompt. It's the first thing a fresh
// user sees — they may have heard nothing about C3 beyond "useful for
// sending Telegram messages to Claude Code, especially voice".
//
// The DRAFT footer is NOT embedded here — it is appended by
// renderPreamble when draftApproved is false. This keeps the body
// stable across draft/approved transitions and lets the test suite
// assert on both modes from one source.
//
// Editing guidance:
//   - Karthi rejects multi-line paragraphs. Keep blocks ≤3 lines.
//   - Cover four things only: what C3 does, what's about to happen,
//     what the user needs handy, and the consent question.
//   - The TestPreambleCopy_ContainsKeyConcepts test enforces presence
//     of the load-bearing terms (bot, group, topic, voice, Telegram,
//     STT). If you remove one of those concepts, update the test.
const preambleBody = `C3 — what it is

  C3 lets you talk to your Claude Code (or Codex) CLI sessions from
  Telegram. Text and voice both work — voice messages are transcribed
  by a custom STT pipeline (Gemini 3 Flash, Sarvam Saaras as fallback)
  and surfaced to the CLI as text. Agent replies come back into Telegram.

What we're about to set up

  1. A Telegram bot — your phone-side endpoint. Made via @BotFather.
     (If you don't have one yet, I'll walk you through it.)
  2. A Telegram group with Topics enabled — one topic per CLI session,
     so multiple projects don't collide in one chat.
  3. ~/.config/c3/mappings.json — a 600-mode config file with your bot
     token and chat ids. Stays on this machine.
  4. C3 binaries — built from source via ` + "`go install ./cmd/...`" + `.
     I'll kick this off in the background while you wire up Telegram.

What you'll need handy

  - A Telegram bot token (the 1234567:abc... string from @BotFather).
    If you don't have one yet, that's fine — I'll point you at
    @BotFather and walk through it.
  - Your own Telegram user id (for DMs from the bot).
  - A supergroup with Topics on, and its chat id.

  All three can be set up in the next 5 minutes if you're new to this.
