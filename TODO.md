# TODO

Status as of 2026-05-09. Locked spec is
[`docs/specs/2026-05-08-c3-rearch-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-05-08-c3-rearch-design.md).
Re-prioritize against the spec when picking next work.

## In flight (user-driven)

- [ ] **First-run validation of the Go broker.** Paste the install
  one-liner into a fresh Claude Code session, walk through `INSTALL.md`,
  then `cd` into a project, `attach`, and confirm a real Telegram
  round-trip. Surfaces any rough edges before public GitHub push.

## Pre-release UX bugs (surfaced 2026-05-13)

Surfaced during install/attach pilot. Must fix before the public push.

### Second-round bugs surfaced 2026-05-14 (post-computer-restart resume)

- [x] **Welcome message never fired after broker bounce + fresh user attach.**
  Done 2026-05-14. Root cause: a 30s post-startup `welcomeRecoveryWindow`
  was added as belt-and-suspenders for adapters that didn't yet thread
  the `Replay` flag — but it false-positived against legitimate
  user-typed attaches landing within 30s of broker startup. Replay
  flag is the authoritative signal; the window was removed
  (`internal/broker/attach.go:sendWelcome`,
  `internal/broker/broker.go`). Regression test:
  `TestSendWelcome_FreshUserAttachJustAfterBrokerStartup_Fires`.
- [x] **`c3` MCP plugin shows "disconnected" on Claude Code `--resume`,
  requires manual `/mcp` reconnect.** Done 2026-05-14. Hardened the
  adapter against the observed failure mode where Claude Code spawns
  the adapter but never sends an MCP frame (orphaned spawn during
  session resume teardown). Three changes in
  `cmd/c3-claude-adapter/main.go`: (1) signal handlers
  (SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP) that log + cancel ctx so future incidents
  leave a breadcrumb in adapter.log; (2) idle-startup watchdog —
  if no MCP frame within 60s of startup, exit cleanly so the adapter
  doesn't zombie holding a broker conn; (3) explicit exit-reason
  logging at every return path. Regression tests:
  `TestIdleStartupWatchdog_CancelsWhenNoDispatch`,
  `TestIdleStartupWatchdog_StaysQuietAfterDispatch`,
  `TestDispatch_SetsDispatchedFlag`. Open follow-up: deeper Claude
  Code MCP lifecycle interactions on resume are still
  poorly-understood — surface a heartbeat and a singleton-PID guard
  if symptoms recur.
- [x] **Stale claim after `/mcp` reconnect blocks inbound delivery AND
  fallback.** Done 2026-05-14. Sequence Karthi hit: `/c3:attach` (got
  welcome ✅) → `/mcp` reconnect (CC kills old adapter, spawns new) →
  old adapter dies; broker's conn-drop defer marks stub disconnected
  but doesn't release the claim. New inbounds hit `deliver FAIL:
  holder.Conn is not *ipc.Conn` (type-assertion on nil conn) and no
  fallback fires either (a stale-but-present claim ≠ no claim). Fixes:
  (1) `internal/broker/worker.go:forwardOrFallback` now calls
  `holder.IsAlive()` at dispatch time; dead-holder claims are released
  in-place and the message falls through to the fallback path; alive-
  but-disconnected holders cause a SKIP log (adapter is between
  reconnects). (2) `internal/broker/handler.go` conn-drop defer now
  checks `isPIDAlive(stub.PID)` and releases claims when the PID is
  already dead at conn-drop time. Regression tests:
  `TestForwardOrFallback_StaleClaim_ReleasesAndFallsThrough`,
  `TestForwardOrFallback_AliveButDisconnectedHolder_SkipsDelivery`.

- [x] **Welcome message on attach.** Done 2026-05-14
  (`internal/broker/attach.go:sendWelcome`). Friendly tone, no PID, async,
  suppressed for adapter-replay re-attaches (broker bounce or conn-drop
  recovery doesn't spam the topic).
- [x] **CLI doesn't actually `cd` into the named project.** Done
  2026-05-14 via `~/arogara/AGENTS.md` rule "Hard rule — `cd` before
  anything else when switching projects". Promoted to its own section
  near the top of the C3 attach docs so it's impossible to miss.
  Multi-project caveat documented for the rare case where staying at
  the parent and using absolute paths is correct. Not a broker change —
  shell discipline lives in agent instructions.
- [x] **Default cwd for a fresh topic = launch root, not project root.**
  Done 2026-05-14 (`internal/broker/attach.go:resolveAttachCWD`). The
  broker now refines launch_cwd → launch_cwd/topic_name when that
  subdirectory exists, so attaching to multiple topics from the same
  parent directory persists distinct mappings.
- [x] **Mappings registry allows duplicate default cwd across topics.**
  Done 2026-05-14, hardened later same day per voice feedback
  (`internal/broker/attach.go:persistMapping`). Broker now REFUSES to
  silently rebind a saved cwd → topic mapping when a different topic
  is being attached from the same cwd. Live claim still proceeds;
  only an explicit `~/.config/c3/mappings.json` edit can change the
  saved default. Loud log line on refusal.

## Completed follow-up (D011 — Plan 7: Codex bridge in Go)

Landed 2026-05-09. The Go broker now supports Codex through the Go launcher
and Go adapter.

- [x] **`cmd/c3-codex-adapter`** — WS forwarder implemented. Inbound C3
  messages are submitted to the Codex app-server as turns.
- [x] **`cmd/codex/main.go`** — launcher binary that intercepts the `codex`
  command and shims to the adapter (parallels how the Claude adapter is
  loaded as an MCP server).
- [x] **`c3-broker install-codex-shim`** — subcommand that symlinks the
  launcher into the user's PATH.

## Broker — small follow-ups

- [ ] **`c3-broker release <cwd>` runtime IPC op.** Currently stubbed. Lets
  a project free its attached topic without restarting the broker.
- [x] **Adapter auto-recover beyond reconnect-once.** Done 2026-05-09.
  `recoverBroker` (exponential backoff 0.5s → 30s, no give-up) +
  `replayLastAttach` (re-issues the last successful attach on reconnect)
  in `cmd/c3-claude-adapter/main.go`. A long-running session now survives
  a broker bounce without restarting Claude Code.

## Telegram resilience — OpenClaw parity

Surfaced 2026-05-09 after the polling-timeout bug fix. Source: OpenClaw's
`extensions/telegram/` (grammy-based). Most items landed 2026-05-09 in the
same session.

- [x] **Honor `parameters.retry_after` on Telegram 429.** Done in
  `internal/channel/telegram/poll.go` pollLoop (cap 60s).
- [x] **401 circuit-breaker.** Done — `authBreaker` in
  `internal/channel/telegram/resilience.go`; trips after 10 consecutive
  401s, sleeps 5min between probes, clears on any success.
- [x] **409 Conflict detection.** Done — pollLoop logs loud and `return`s
  when classifyError returns `errClassConflict`.
- [x] **Per-method timeout policy.** Done — `timeoutFor(method, longPoll)`
  in resilience.go, used via `requestOptsFor()` from every gotgbot call
  site. Long-poll budget is now `25s + 30s = 55s`.
- [x] **Error classification: transient-network vs permanent-API.** Done —
  `classifyError` + `isTransientNetworkError` in resilience.go. Permanent
  errors (other 4xx) feed the auth breaker; transient errors get the
  exponential backoff path; conflict and rate-limited get their own paths.
- [x] **Persisted update-id watermark.** Done — `offsetStore` in
  `internal/channel/telegram/offset_store.go` writes
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/c3/telegram-offset.json` after each successful
  GetUpdates. pollLoop seeds `offset` from this on startup.
- [x] **Outbound rate-limiting.** Done — `rateLimiter` in
  `internal/channel/telegram/rate.go` using `golang.org/x/time/rate`.
  Global 30/sec, group 20/min, private 1/sec (burst 5). Wired into every
  outbound call in `outbound.go`.
- [x] **Per-update semantic dedup.** Done — `updateDedup` LRU in
  `internal/channel/telegram/dedup.go` (capacity 2000, TTL 5min).
- [ ] **Sequentialize per-chat handler dispatch.** **Already provided** by
  the per-route worker pool — `internal/broker/worker.go` runs one
  goroutine per `RouteKey = (channel, chat_id, *topic_id)`, serializing
  inbound + outbound for that route. Worth a tighter test (concurrent
  inbound interleaving) but no new code needed. Marked done.

Skipped (intentional):
- Transport-level fallback chain (IPv4-sticky / pinned IP) — overkill for
  our deployment shape.
- Media-group debounce (500ms hold-and-merge) — only matters for
  multi-photo album sends, not in any current flow.

## Phase 3 — User & Access Management (not started)

- [ ] **Per-user access control** — who can talk to which CLI.
- [ ] **Pairing flow** — new users get a pairing code, approved by master
  CLI or admin.
- [ ] **Master Telegram user** — admin who can configure the system from
  Telegram itself.

## Phase 4 — Advanced (not started)

- [ ] **Inter-CLI messaging** — CLI-1 sends a message to CLI-2 through the
  broker.
- [ ] **Topic creation via API** beyond the attach proposal flow —
  programmatic topic management for admins.
- [ ] **Monitoring dashboard** — connected adapters, message counts, STT
  stats.
- [ ] **Persistent message history** — context recovery across CLI
  restarts.
- [ ] **Slash commands handled in the broker** — `/status`, `/list`,
  `/route`, etc. without round-tripping to the LLM. OpenClaw-style fast
  ops.
- [ ] **Stream thinking / tool calls to Telegram** — research best UX
  first.
- [ ] **Web chat channel** — second `Channel` impl alongside Telegram.
  Magic-link URL flow. The pluggable channel layer is already in place
  (D007).
- [ ] **Voice mode channel** — continuous voice (record → send → read aloud).
  Driving / hands-free.
- [ ] **Live CLI view** — see what's happening in the CLI from the remote
  interface.

  reconnect-once on adapter
- Plan 5: plugin host + STT plugin
- Plan 6: Claude Code MCP adapter — end-to-end live, 7 tools, manual

  `/c3-build`/`/c3-setup`/`/c3-status` slash commands, `c3-broker setup` /
  `status` / `validate` subcommands, root `INSTALL.md` single-line install
- Plan 10: doc pass — D009 added, README + RESUME + TODO rewritten to
  current state
