# C3 — Roadmap

What's next for C3 after v1. Everything here is future or unbuilt; shipped work is in git history. One line per item — details land in the design when each is built.

## Interactive & trust

- Interactive Q&A: free-text / "Other" / comment answers (single/multi-select + Skip already ship).
- Native free-text option in the attach picker — today "type your own" is body prose (`/c3:attach <name>`); a real free-text choice needs the deferred free-text answer surface above.
- Codex parity for tap-to-approve, `ask`, and `detach`.
- Per-user access control — who is allowed to drive which CLI.
- Trusted-operator authorization for actions the CLI would otherwise hard-deny.
- Permission-relay niceties: "see more" expansion, a text `y/n` fallback.

## Reach

- Remote spawn + control of Claude Code / Codex sessions from chat.
- Inter-agent messaging — one agent can message another's channel (rate-limited).
- Stream the agent's reasoning to the channel.
- Be the phone surface for session managers (Claude Squad, CCManager, Conductor, …).

## More channels

- Web-chat and voice-mode channels via the `Channel` interface.
- Other transports the interface already admits (Slack, Matrix, …).

## Telegram completeness

- Media-group / album assembly, media echo by `file_id`, message forwarding.
- Richer formatting (underline, inline mentions), location sends, more poll options.

## Packaging & platform

- Drop the development-channels flag once C3 ships through a trusted plugin store.
- External (non-Go) loadable plugins.
- Broker-side `/list` and `/route` commands.
- Monitoring dashboard, persistent message history, STT latency instrumentation.
- Async-dispatch more non-critical broker sends (as the voice-readback echo already does), preserving strict per-topic ordering.
- Id-targeted, delivery-contingent consume — ack/consume specific message ids only when their delivery succeeded, closing the orphaned-consume loss window (adapter abandons a fetch, broker consumes anyway). Needed by the pooled-queue work regardless.
- Attach-replay refinements: gate `disambiguate_dm` on `Replay`, and honor `group` in the step-2 name lookup, so a replayed DM or non-default-group attach restores cleanly instead of falling to a discarded proposal.
- Surface the silent auto-recover skip: when a resumed session's own last topic is held by another live session, carry a `Skipped`/reason field and show a one-line CLI notice, instead of resuming quietly with no explanation.
- Idempotent-attach hint: an already-attached bare `attach` could return an "already attached to X — to switch topics attach by name, or detach first" hint instead of a bare confirmation. Needs an additive `AttachedMsg` field so the formatter can tell an idempotent re-confirm apart from a fresh claim.

## Open design questions

- Whether a typed free-text answer is also queued as a normal message, or consumed only as the answer.
- Grant UX for operator authorization (per-action prompt vs standing grant).
