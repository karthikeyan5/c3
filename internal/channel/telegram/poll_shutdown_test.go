// Item A (shutdown-save): on loop exit the poll loop must persist the highest
// durably-committed offset, even when the final advance landed AFTER the
// per-batch save already ran for that iteration (the realistic gap: the broker's
// async persist callback MarkDone-s an in-flight update between the per-batch
// Save and shutdown). Without the final defer-Save, that last advance would be
// lost and a restart would re-deliver it.
//
// Construction: the bot delivers ONE allowed message update (update_id=5). It is
// Registered in-flight and Emitted, but no persist callback fires in this test,
// so committed stays 0 through the per-batch Save (it can't pass an in-flight
// update) — lastSaved stays 0 and the per-batch path persists nothing. The bot's
// SECOND call then BLOCKS until ctx is cancelled, parking the loop inside
// getUpdates so no per-batch Save can race. We externally MarkDone(5) (the
// worker's post-Append callback), advancing committed to 5, then cancel. Only the
// shutdown defer can persist 5 — the test fails without it.
