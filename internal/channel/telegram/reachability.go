// reachability combines the inbound (fetchHealth) and outbound (outboundHealth)
// sub-states into the ONE telegram reachability signal the status line shows.
// The broker/status-line contract is one health entry per channel NAME
// (healthFileEntry, health.json), so both directions MUST surface on the single
// "telegram" entry: inbound-down and outbound-down for one root cause (the wire
// is down ⇒ both fail) must NEVER produce two separate notifications.
//
//	combinedDown = inboundDown || outboundDown
//
// A notification fires ONLY on the combined edge: UP→DOWN when the FIRST sub
// goes down, DOWN→UP when the LAST sub clears. Sub-state churn while already
// combined-DOWN (e.g. outbound flips down after inbound already took the state
// down) is silent.
//
// Locking (single-lock, single-source-of-truth — 2026-07-07 review fix): the
// combiner OWNS the outboundHealth machine (r.out) and drives EVERY outbound op
// (outboundFailure/outboundSuccess and the wire-proof reset in recordInbound)
// while holding r.mu, so the machine op and the combiner recompute are ATOMIC
// and r.outboundDown is ALWAYS set `= r.out.down` (authoritative — from the
// machine's state, never from a transition edge). This is what makes the two
// impossible to diverge: the previous design kept outbound down-state in TWO
// booleans under TWO locks (outboundHealth.mu + r.mu) updated non-atomically and
// derived r.outboundDown from the transition, which allowed a permanent wedge
// (F1) and a masked outage (F2). r.out has NO lock of its own now.
//
// recordInbound/outboundFailure/outboundSuccess run on MANY goroutines — inbound
// from the poll loop, the silence watchdog, and the heartbeat; outbound from the
// route worker (SendReply) and detached echo goroutines (readback). ONE mutex
// (r.mu) covers ALL of them and ALL of r.out. The inbound sub-machine
// (fetchHealth) keeps its own lock, taken/released by the caller BEFORE r.mu is
// acquired (reportHealth) — the two locks are SEQUENTIAL, never nested, so there
// is no lock-ordering deadlock; r.mu is the only lock for all outbound+combiner
// state.

// this lock — r.out.ForceReset() + r.outboundDown=false are ATOMIC with any
// concurrent outboundFailure/outboundSuccess (they all take r.mu). This is the F2
// fix: previously ForceReset (under outboundHealth.mu) and the outboundDown clear
