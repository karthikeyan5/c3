// drain.go is the pooled-queue drain core (design spec
// docs/.loop/pooled-queue-DESIGN-SPEC.md §4 + amendments A1/A2/A4, B1/B6/B8).
// Broker.Drain is the SINGLE implementation every front door calls — the
// /drain Telegram command (phase 3), and any future MCP verb or confirm card
// are thin parsers over the same function (COMMANDS.md "implemented once").
//
// The 4-step flow, each durable step on the route's OWNING worker so the
// store's single-owner discipline holds (internal/queue/store.go):
//
//	Step A  JobDrainPeek   on the SOURCE worker — freeze the selection as a
//	        MULTISET of (MessageID → count) + the captured lines (A2: edited
//	        messages re-dispatch with the SAME id, so a queue can legitimately
//	        hold two lines with one id; ordinals number LINES, not unique ids).
//	Step B  JobDrainAppend on the TARGET worker — presence-check per
//	        (MessageID, DrainedFrom) COUNTS, stamp DrainedFrom with the
//	        canonical NUMERIC source key (B6), rewrite the routing fields,
//	        bake the provenance banner into Text, fsync'd Append. This is the
//	        durability commit (INV-1). The target's deliveredDedup is NEVER
//	        seeded (INV-8).
//	Step C  JobDrainRemove on the SOURCE worker — RemoveIDs with the frozen
//	        counts; surviving-intersection semantics (INV-5): a frozen line a
//	        concurrent fetch consumed meanwhile is reported, not an error.
//	Step D  advisory, best-effort — a live alive holder on the target gets a
//	        targeted SystemEvent nudge via a DIRECT conn write (A4: never the
//	        forwardOrFallback/worker push path); otherwise ONE drain-notice is
//	        posted to the target topic. The durable queue is the only truth.
