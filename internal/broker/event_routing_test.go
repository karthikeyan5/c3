// --- CB-1: the route worker must be event-aware ---------------------------
//
// mergeBatch (the debounce collapse) historically copied ONLY the text/media
// fields and dropped any Kind/Event, and flushInbounds ran hasVoice/STT over
// whatever was in the batch. So an inbound EVENT sharing a debounce window with
// a text message would be corrupted (its Kind/Event spliced away) and an event
// would be run through STT. The fix: an event flushes ALONE (never merged into a
// text batch) and BYPASSES the voice/STT path. These tests prove both.

// TestCB1_EventSharingWindowDeliveredIntactAndSeparately drives the real run
// loop: a text message and a poll_result event are submitted back-to-back into
// one debounce window. The event must be forwarded (a) as its own inbound, not
// concatenated into the text, and (b) with its Kind/Event intact.
