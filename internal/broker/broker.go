// Broker holds the in-memory state shared by all connections: stubs registry,
// routes table, worker pool, channel registry, fallback tracker, and a
// copy-on-write atomic pointer to the mappings.json config snapshot.
//
// Concurrency model for the mappings pointer:
//   - Readers call Mappings() — atomic Load, lock-free, always returns a
//     consistent immutable snapshot.
//   - Writers (UpsertTopic/UpsertMapping during attach, SetMappings on
//     SIGHUP reload) go through mutateMappings(), which holds mutationMu
//     across a Clone → mutate → Store cycle. Concurrent mutations
//     serialize; readers never see a half-updated state.
//
// Previously Mappings was a public *MappingsFile field accessed directly
// by ~20 call sites across attach/handler/worker. Concurrent
// HandleConn goroutines mutated the inner maps via UpsertTopic while
// other goroutines iterated them via range — classic Go data race
// (BLOCKER, code-review 2026-05-15).
