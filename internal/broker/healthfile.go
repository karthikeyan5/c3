// healthFile is the top-level wrapper written to health.json. It carries broker

//
//   - BrokerPID is os.Getpid(); a reader does kill(pid,0) (or equivalent) and
//     treats "pid not alive" as broker-down/unknown regardless of channel state.
//   - WrittenUnix is refreshed on EVERY write (edges + the slow refresh ticker),
//     so a reader treats now-WrittenUnix > 2x the refresh interval (>90s) as a
//     stale/dead broker even when the pid happens to be reused.
//
// Previously the top level was a flat map of channel→entry, which froze at its
// last value (usually "up") when the broker process died, showing green while
// C3 was completely dead (audit finding health-observability-2).

// WriteHealthFile atomically writes the current broker-liveness + per-channel
// health snapshot to HealthFilePath() for the status line to read. Best-effort:
// any error is logged and ignored (the status cache + broker log are the
// backstops). broker_pid and written_unix are stamped on EVERY call so a reader
// can detect a frozen/dead broker; written_unix is refreshed by the slow ticker
// (startHealthRefresh) even when no health edge has fired. At startup lastHealth
// is empty, so channels is "{}" — clearing any stale per-channel state from a
// prior crash and reading as "no outage" while still carrying live pid/time.
// Atomic via CreateTemp-in-same-dir + rename; no fsync (best-effort).
//
// Concurrency: lastHealthSnapshot() reads under the broker's healthMu; the
// wrapper fields (pid, written_unix) are stack-local per call, so concurrent
// WriteHealthFile calls (edge-driven + ticker-driven) each produce one complete
// generation and the atomic rename makes the last writer win — no shared
// mutable state is introduced.
