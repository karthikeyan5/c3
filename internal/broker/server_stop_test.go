// TestServer_StopUnblocksParkedConnection is the direct regression guard for the
// SIGTERM drain-wedge. An adapter keeps a persistent connection whose HandleConn
// goroutine sits in a blocking ReadFrame. The OLD Stop() closed only the listener
// and then wg.Wait()'d on that goroutine forever — the broker logged "shutting
// down" and hung until SIGKILL. The fix closes the accepted connection too, so
// the read unblocks and Stop() returns promptly.
//
// Crucially, the test NEVER closes the client side before Stop — that is the
// whole point: a live adapter stays connected, and shutdown must not depend on it
// hanging up.
